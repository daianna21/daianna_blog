# Introduction

# What you'll learn here

1.  How to interpret the coefficients in the design matrices.
2.  Understand the syntaxis of interaction coefficients and learn how to interpret and utilize them.
3.  

# An example data set

We'll use recount3 package to download real gene expression data from a study, including sample metadata and QC metrics that will be helpful to illustrate variable associations with gene expression data.

The chosen study can be found in the Sequence Read Archive ([SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)) with project ID SRP107565, and is titled "**Multiomics Profiling Establishes the Polypharmacology of FDA-Approved CDK4/6 Inhibitors and the Potential for Differential Clinical Activity".**

```{r download_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(recount3)
# 
# ## Download all available projects in human in recount3
# human_projects <- available_projects()
# 
# ## Download gene expression data and metadata from 
# proj_info <- subset(
#     human_projects,
#     project == "SRP107565" & project_type == "data_sources"
# )
# 
# 
# rse_gene_SRP009615 <- create_rse(project_info)
```
