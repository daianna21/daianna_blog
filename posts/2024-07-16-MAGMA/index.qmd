# Introduction

MAGMA stands for **Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation** and is a computational tool for the analysis of the joint effect of multiple genetic markers on a phenotype based on Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data. MAGMA constitutes a flexible and generalizable approach to assess the **association** of [**individual genes**]{.underline} or [**gene-sets**]{.underline} with a **phenotype** based on the associations that the [**SNPs**]{.underline} of the genes have with the same phenotype.

This is a commonly used method that you'll likely find implemented while reading about GWASes or that you'll need to run if working with genetic variant associations and gene-set enrichment analysis, so let's see how it works.

# What you'll learn here

1.  Global description of the analyses MAGMA allows to run at gene and gene-set levels.

2.  A more detailed demonstration of the SNP-wise gene analysis implemented in MAGMA: inputs, commands and outputs ….

# How does it work?

MAGMA allows to first perform a gene analysis and subsequently a gene-set analysis based on gene-level results. Note, however, that the gene-set analysis comes as a separate layer and it is an additional optional step, though it is frequently performed and quite useful.

## **Gene analysis**

Genetic markers are aggregated to the level of whole individual genes and those in a given gene are jointly tested for their association with the phenotype, defining in such way the association of the gene itself. This definitely allows to detect significant associations of multiple small-effect markers in a gene that individually would be missed, i.e., associations that depend on multiple markers. This also reduces the number of required tests and makes the results more interpretable by summarizing at the gene level.

Two alternatives for gene analysis are offered by MAGMA:

### [**Multiple linear PC regression model**]{style="color:#FF7256"}

If the input data is **raw genotype data**, MAGMA fits a multiple linear PC regression model to the individuals' phenotypes. Here, for one gene $g$ at a time, the SNP matrix that contains the information of the SNPs for that gene across all the $N$ individuals studied, is projected onto its Principal Components (PCs). These PCs capture genotypic differences between individuals for the given gene and the first $K$ most explanatory ones (comprising 99.9% of the variance) are used as predictors of the phenotype ($Y$) in the linear model.

![](images/MAGMA_PC_model.png){fig-align="center" width="650"}

Phenotype is modeled as:

$$
Y = \alpha_{0g}+X^*_{g}\alpha_g+W\beta_g+\epsilon_g
$$

$$
{\begin{bmatrix}Y_1 \\ ... \\ Y_{N-1} \\ Y_N\end{bmatrix}} = {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{0g} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{0g} \\ \alpha_{0g}\end{bmatrix}} + \stackrel{PC1 \ \  \ \  \ \ PC2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ PC_K} {\begin{bmatrix}  x_{11} \ \ x_{12} \ \ ... \ \ x_{1K}  \\  ... \\ x_{(N-1)1} \ \ x_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{(N-1)K} \\  x_{N1} \ \ x_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{NK} \end{bmatrix}} {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{g1} \\  \alpha_{g2} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{gK}\end{bmatrix}} +  \stackrel{Cov1 \ \  \ \  \ \ Cov2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ CovL}{\begin{bmatrix}  w_{11} \ \ w_{12} \ \ ... \ \ w_{1L}  \\  ... \\ w_{(N-1)1} \ \ w_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{(N-1)L} \\  w_{N1} \ \ w_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{NL} \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{g1} \\  \beta_{g2} \\ ... \\ \beta_{gL}\end{bmatrix}} +
{\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{g1} \\ ... \\ \epsilon_{g(N-1)} \\  \epsilon_{gN}\end{bmatrix}}
$$

With $X_{g}^*$ the matrix of the first $K$ PCs for gene $g$ and $W$ a matrix of additional covariates for the individuals that can be included in the model. $\alpha_g$'s and $\beta_g$'s are the coefficients of the PCs and covariates for the gene $g$, respectively. $\epsilon_g$ is the vector of residuals and $\alpha_{0g}$ the intercept. The $\alpha_g$'s represent the effect of the genotype for gene $g$ on the phenotype (the **genetic effect**).

Then an F-test is used to assess if genotypes for gene $g$ have an effect on the phenotype under the null hypothesis that the genetic effect of $g$ on the phenotype is 0 across all PCs ($H_0:\alpha_g=\overrightarrow 0$). This leads to a *p*-value for the association of gene $g$ with the phenotype $Y$ based on its genetic markers.

✔️ The advantage of using PCs instead of variables for individual SNPs is that 1) the number of variables included in the linear model is reduced and 2) they allow to account for redundancy and collinearity between SNPs. Also this model offers flexibility to accommodate additional covariates to model the phenotype.

### [**SNP-wise gene analysis**]{style="color:#7AC5CD"}

If no raw genotype data is available, MAGMA also accepts [**SNP *p*-values**]{.underline} from a GWAS as input. In this case SNP *p*-values for a gene are first transformed into [**Z or** $\chi^2$**statistics**]{.underline} and then combined into a [**gene test-statistic**]{.underline} by the [**mean SNP statistic**]{style="background-color: #F0FFF0"} or [**top SNP statistic**]{style="background-color:#FFF0F5"} method. This gene test-statistic is then used to compute the [**gene *p*-value**]{.underline}, either by an approximation of the sampling distribution (mean SNP statistic method) or by phenotype permutation (mean and top SNP statistic methods).

This SNP-wise MAGMA analysis based on SNP summary statistics requires a **reference dataset** with similar ancestry as the data from which SNPs *p*-values were computed. This is needed to account for LD between SNPs. If an approximation of the sampling distribution is used to compute the gene *p*-value, this reference is required to obtain the SNP statistic correlation matrix $R$. If phenotype permutation is chosen, these reference data are necessary to generate the gene test-statistics empirical sampling distribution.

Summary: SNP *p*-values → SNP statistics →[**\***]{style="color:#EE00EE"}gene test-statistic →[**\***]{style="color: #00CD00"} gene *p*-value → gene *z*-score ($z_g$)
:::

[**\***]{style="color:#EE00EE"}Gene test-statistics can be constructed from the SNP statistics applying one of two implemented methods in MAGMA:

-   [**Mean SNP statistic**]{style="background-color: #F0FFF0"}:

    -   **Mean Z gene test-statistic**: SNP *p*-values of a gene are transformed to Z-statistics and the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of such Z-stats is used as the test-statistic of the gene: $T=\sum_i^G w_iz_i$, with $G$ the total number of SNPs of the gene and $z_i$ and $w_i$ the Z-statistic and weight for SNP $i$, respectively. These gene test-stats follow a normal distribution.

    -   **Mean** $\chi^2$ **gene test-statistic**: the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of the $-2log$ of the SNP *p*-values (that are $\sim\chi^2_{(2)}$) is used as gene test-statistic: $T=-2\sum_i^G w_i\log(p_i)$, with $p_i$ the *p*-value of SNP $i$. These gene test-stats are assumed to be $\sim c\chi^2_{(f)}$, where $c$ and $f$ are constants of the distribution.

    [**\***]{style="color: #00CD00"}For both mean Z and mean $\chi^2$ gene test-statistics the *p*-value of the gene is obtained based on a known **approximation of the sampling distribution** of the gene test-stats. For such purposes, the reference dataset is needed to estimate the SNP statistic correlation matrix, from which the optional SNP weights ($w_i$) are computed to correct for dependency between SNPs. A phenotype permutation procedure can also be applied to compute empirical gene *p*-values (see further below).

-   [**Top SNP statistic(s)**]{style="background-color:#FFF0F5"}: the lowest SNP *p*-value among all SNPs in the gene (corresponding to the most associated SNP) or the sum of the $-log(p)$ for the top most associated SNPs is used as the gene test-statistic.

    [**\***]{style="color: #00CD00"}To compute the gene *p*-value a **phenotype permutation** procedure is the only option available. Here random phenotypes are assigned to the reference data and a top gene test-statistic is computed in each permutation. The empirical gene *p*-value is computed as the proportion of these permuted gene test-statistics that are higher than the observed one.

::: callout-note
The SNP-wise gene analysis of MAGMA can also be run with raw genotype data, in which case SNP *p*-values are computed internally and the raw genotype data takes place of the reference data.
:::

After running the gene analysis, either by PC regression or SNP-wise analysis, the resulting gene *p*-values are subsequently transformed to z-scores ($z_g$) to be introduced in the gene-set analysis. These z-scores capture the association of the genes with the phenotype. (HEREEEEE)

## Gene-set analysis

Once having gene-level associations, we can now think of gene set associations. Intiatlly, we aggregate genes in groups of genes that share cellular or functional properties, such as involvements in certain biological processes, with particular molecular functions, cellular locations, cell-type specific expression or activity, or differential expression for a given condition. These define concrete processes or features we may be interested in relating with a GWAS phenotype. By doing this, we can gain insights into the potential molecules, pathways, and tissues implicated in a phenotype's etiology.

Since all that's necessary from the gene analysis to run the gene-set analysis are the gene *z*-scores, gene-set analysis operates the same independently of the gene analysis method applied (PC regression or SNP-wise), as both result in gene *p*-values and respective *z*-scores.

Two gene-level regression models are implemented:

Genes of our particular interest are in turn aggregated into gene sets depending on their biological functions or other shared characteristics/involvements (such as being up/down DEGs). Analyzing gene sets evidently reduces the number of output tests but the gene analysis still has to be performed.

# Example of SNP-wise gene analysis and competitive gene-set analysis

By default the SNP-wise gene analysis method implemented is the mean Z gene test-statistic, and the default gene-set analysis is the competitive one. Let's exemplify how to run these analyses. The following are the three main steps implemented by MAGMA.

## Step 1: Annotation of SNPs onto genes

The first step is to map all SNPs from your GWAS data onto the genes of a reference genome.

-   **Input**: we need SNP and gene positions based on the same human genome reference build; we provide this in the `.snploc` and in the `.gene.loc` files, respectively.

    ``` {.Bash style="padding: 14px"}
    ## .snploc file example
    ## Columns: SNP ID, Chr, Position:

           SNP CHR         BP 
    rs62513865   8  101592213 
    rs79643588   8  106973048 
    rs17396518   8  108690829 
    rs983166     8  108681675 
    rs28842593   8  103044620 
    rs7014597    8  104152280 
    rs3134156    8  100479917 
    rs6980591    8  103144592 
    rs72670434   8  108166508
    ```

    ``` {.Bash style="padding: 14px"}
    ## .gene.loc file example
    ## Required columns: GeneID, Chr, Start site, Stop site:

    ENSG00000243485 1 29554 31109 + MIR1302-2HG 
    ENSG00000186092 1 65419 71585 + OR4F5 
    ENSG00000238009 1 89295 133723 - AL627309.1 
    ENSG00000239906 1 139790 140339 - AL627309.2 
    ENSG00000236601 5 180881343 180888537 - AL732372.1 
    ENSG00000235146 1 523009 530148 + AC114498.1 
    ENSG00000229905 1 696291 697369 + AL669831.2 
    ENSG00000237491 1 714150 745440 + AL669831.5
    ```

    ::: callout-important
    SNPs in sexual chromosomes are usually excluded from the analysis as their inclusion brings additional analytical, statistical, and bioinformatic challenges for their analysis [@sun2023]. MAGMA only supports X chromosome analysis.
    :::

-   **Commands**: the following are the flags and inputs used to map the SNPs onto genes.

    ``` {.Bash style="padding:14px"}
    ## Run SNP annotation: 
    ## --annotate: flag to run annotation 
    ## --snp-loc: indicate file with SNP positions
    ## --gene-loc: indicate file with gene positions
    ## --out: prefix for output files

    magma --annotate \ 
          --snp-loc [.snploc file]\ 
          --gene-loc [gene.loc file]\ 
          --out [output_prefix]
    ```

-   **Output**: this step returns the `.genes.annot` file as output, containing all SNPs that were assigned to a gene.

    ``` {.Bash style="padding:14px"}
    ## .genes.annot file example
    ## GeneID Chr:Start:Stop and corresponding SNP rsIDs:

    window_up = 0 
    window_down = 0 
    ENSG00000237491 1:714150:745440 rs186002080 rs12184267 rs142557973 rs149887893 
    ENSG00000177757 1:752751:755217 rs3115859 rs3131968 rs3131967 rs3115860 
    ENSG00000225880 1:761586:762902 rs2286139 rs377377186 rs374493323 
    ENSG00000230368 1:803451:812283 rs11240779 rs28410559 rs72631880 rs58686784 
    ```

## Step 2: SNP-wise gene analysis

-   **Input**: we need to provide the SNP *p*-values in the `.pval` file and the gene-wise SNPs in the `.genes.annot` file obtained in the previous step. A reference dataset must be provided as well.

    The total sample size (N) of the GWAS from which the SNP *p*-values were derived must be indicated as well using the *N* modifier of `--pval`. Alternatively, if different sample sizes were used per SNP, these can be contained in a separate column of the `.pval` file which specified in the *ncol* modifier of `--pval`.

    ``` {.Bash style="padding:14px"}
    ## .pval file example
    ## Columns: SNP ID, SNP p-value, and optionally SNP sample size 

           SNP      P      N 
    rs62513865 0.4847 130644 
    rs79643588 0.5605 130644 
    rs17396518 0.8145 130644 
    rs983166   0.5704 130644 
    rs28842593 0.7488 130644 
    rs7014597  0.5034 130644 
    rs3134156  0.2225 130644
    ```

    The next is a `head` of the 1000 Genomes European panel data used as the reference dataset.

    ``` {.Bash style="padding:14px"}
    ## g1000_eur reference data example
    ## Columns: Chr, SNP ID, Genetic distance, Position, Allele1, Allele2

    1 rs537182016 0 10539 A C 
    1 rs575272151 0 11008 G C 
    1 rs544419019 0 11012 G C 
    1 rs540538026 0 13110 A G 
    1 rs62635286  0 13116 G T 
    1 rs200579949 0 13118 G A 
    ```

-   **Commands**: these are the flags used to run the SNP-wise mean Z stats method.

    \## Reference data used was the 1000 Genomes European data

    ``` {.Bash style="padding:14px"}
    ## Run gene analysis based on SNP p-values
    ## --bfile
    ## --pval
    ## --gene-annot
    ## --out

    magma 
    --bfile g1000_eur\ 
    ## SNP p-values as input; 
    ## indicate colname for sample size of the study (N) 
    --pval $ANNOT_PREFIX.pval ncol=N\ 
    ## Provide output file from step 1 with gene SNPs 
    --gene-annot $OUTPUT_PREFIX.genes.annot\ 
    --out $OUTPUT_PREFIX
    ```
