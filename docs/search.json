    "text": "A little about me\n\nHey! Daianna here. I graduated from the undergraduate program of Genomic Sciences 🧬 at the National Autonomous University of Mexico 🇲🇽 LCG-UNAM in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico in 2024. Currently I work at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, U.K. analyzing single-cell data from iPSC-derived microglia to unveil the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative diseases.\nDuring the last few years I’ve been involved in multiple omics projects. At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) I analyzed transcriptomic data to explore brain develpment and function 🧠, and at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) I’ve studied genetic variability in genes influencing drug response and toxicity 💊. Along the way, with my undergrad courses and projects, analyzing and dealing with my own data, and attending courses, conferences, and meetings, I’ve learned about statistical analyses and bioinformatic tools and I wanted to share all this knowledge with the scientific community 👥, particularly with other students like me that may not have the same opportunities or academic background but also want to analyze datasets to answer biologically-relevant questions."

    "text": "Motivation for this website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing scientific research, collaborating with my classmates and peers, and assisting in bioinformatics courses I’ve noticed the existence of two common problems while analyzing data:\n\nIn these interconnected times, with praiseworthy collaborative efforts such as the Bioconductor project we can easily develop, share, and use other people’s code, data, methods, and even complete packages for our own analyses. That represents an incredible opportunity for all of us to leverage, contribute, and improve popular and new-emerging computational tools for the reproducible analysis of biological data, no doubts! However, for students and early career researchers, and people coming from areas other than biostatistics, computational biology, or bioinformatics, some analyses may represent obscure –if not completely unknown– territories. People developing these algorithms often assume they have a specialized audience and tend to trivialize underlying statistical concepts and methods when describing their computational functions and packages, not to mention the poor or even missing documentation and support some of the authors offer (with notable exceptions such as limma and variancePartition, among others). \nSecond, nowadays it is incredibly simple to just run a complete pipeline with a single function. That’s efficient and increases productivity but it also has diluted the needed understanding behind their use. I have found many people, including myself, deludedly thinking we master an analysis just because we have run software programs without errors and have received outputs: we may dominate the practice but that doesn’t imply nor guarantees we understand the theory. \n\n\nIt seems to me we are a generation of trained students that know how to run an analysis and obtain results, but don’t understand the analyses themselves; in some occasions, not even the reasons why we execute them. But this is not limited to undergrad or master students: you would be surprised by the number of PhD students, postdocs, and researchers that relate to this!\n\n❗️❗️❗️ More alarming than the aforementioned I’d say, is not to be aware of why it is important to really understand the aims and foundations of the methods we implement. It is not until we do that, that we can make accurate and informed method selections based on the features of our data, detect unexpected and error-announcing results and interpret them correctly, map potential limitations of our analyses and draw rigorous meaningful conclusions from them."

Tutorials, if available, are more detailed materials with usage examples and practical explanations, but again, for theory and methods check the original articles.\nStay humble. If I have become aware of something these years, it is how ignorant we are, something we only learn, paradoxically, as we acquire more knowledge by studying and investigating 📚. Taking an arrogant attitude will only stop you from nourishing yourself with more learnings and ideas, and it will close doors for you. We never stop learning!"

    "text": "Gene analysis\nGenetic markers are aggregated to the level of whole individual genes and those in a given gene are jointly tested for their association with the phenotype, defining in such way the association of the gene itself. This definitely allows to detect significant associations of multiple small-effect markers in a gene that individually would be missed, i.e., associations that depend on multiple markers. This also reduces the number of required tests and makes the results more interpretable by summarizing at the gene level.\nTwo alternatives for gene analysis are offered by MAGMA:\n\nMultiple linear PC regression model\nIf the input data is raw genotype data, MAGMA fits a multiple linear PC regression model to the individuals’ phenotypes. Here, for one gene \\(g\\) at a time, the SNP matrix that contains the information of the SNPs for that gene across all the \\(N\\) individuals studied, is projected onto its Principal Components (PCs). These PCs capture genotypic differences between individuals for the given gene and the first \\(K\\) most explanatory ones (comprising 99.9% of the variance) are used as predictors of the phenotype (\\(Y\\)) in the linear model.\n\nPhenotype is modeled as:\n\\[\nY = \\alpha_{0g}+X^*_{g}\\alpha_g+W\\beta_g+\\epsilon_g\n\\]\n\\[\n{\\begin{bmatrix}Y_1 \\\\ ... \\\\ Y_{N-1} \\\\ Y_N\\end{bmatrix}} = {\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_{0g} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\alpha_{0g} \\\\ \\alpha_{0g}\\end{bmatrix}} + \\stackrel{PC1 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ PC2 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ ...  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ PC_K} {\\begin{bmatrix}  x_{11} \\ \\ x_{12} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{1K}  \\\\  ... \\\\ x_{(N-1)1} \\ \\ x_{(N-1)2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{(N-1)K} \\\\  x_{N1} \\ \\ x_{N2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{NK} \\end{bmatrix}} {\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_{g1} \\\\  \\alpha_{g2} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\alpha_{gK}\\end{bmatrix}} + \\stackrel{Cov1 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ Cov2 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ ...  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CovL}{\\begin{bmatrix}  w_{11} \\ \\ w_{12} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{1L}  \\\\  ... \\\\ w_{(N-1)1} \\ \\ w_{(N-1)2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{(N-1)L} \\\\  w_{N1} \\ \\ w_{N2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{NL} \\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_{g1} \\\\  \\beta_{g2} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\beta_{gL}\\end{bmatrix}} +\n{\\begin{bmatrix}\\epsilon_{g1} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\epsilon_{g(N-1)} \\\\  \\epsilon_{gN}\\end{bmatrix}}\n\\]\nWith \\(X_{g}^*\\) the matrix of the first \\(K\\) PCs for gene \\(g\\) and \\(W\\) a matrix of additional covariates for the individuals that can be included in the model. \\(\\alpha_g\\)’s and \\(\\beta_g\\)’s are the coefficients of the PCs and covariates for the gene \\(g\\), respectively. \\(\\epsilon_g\\) is the vector of residuals and \\(\\alpha_{0g}\\) the intercept. The \\(\\alpha_g\\)’s represent the effect of the genotype for gene \\(g\\) on the phenotype (the genetic effect).\nThen an F-test is used to assess if genotypes for gene \\(g\\) have an effect on the phenotype under the null hypothesis that the genetic effect of \\(g\\) on the phenotype is 0 across all PCs (\\(H_0:\\alpha_g=\\overrightarrow 0\\)). This leads to a p-value for the association of gene \\(g\\) with the phenotype \\(Y\\) based on its genetic markers.\n\n✔️ The advantage of using PCs instead of variables for individual SNPs is that 1) the number of variables included in the linear model is reduced and 2) they allow to account for redundancy and collinearity between SNPs. Also this model offers flexibility to accommodate additional covariates to model the phenotype."
